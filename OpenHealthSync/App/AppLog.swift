//  Category loggers for the app's subsystems. Visible in Xcode's console and
//  in Console.app filtered by the bundle identifier — including on a device
//  with no debugger attached, which is how sync issues in the field get
//  diagnosed. Dynamic values are marked public at the call sites: this is a
//  personal app talking to a self-hosted server, and tokens or credentials
//  never pass through these messages.
